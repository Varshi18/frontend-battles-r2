## Frontend Battle â€“ Round 2: Creativity & Redesign

This project was built for **Frontend Battle 2.0 â€“ Round 2**, held on **June 21, 2025**, from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM IST. The challenge was to take an existing live website and redesign it with enhanced creativity, real-time motion, and interaction-based animations â€” while staying responsive and performant.

## Problem Statement Summary

Participants were tasked with redesigning [inlighntech.com](https://www.inlighntech.com/) using the provided themes and implementing at least 8 high-impact animation features, including kinetic typography, real-time blur, ripple fluidity, and scroll-based transitions.

## Tools & Credits

* Initial JSX layouts and animation setups were scaffolded using **ChatGPT** and **Grok**.
* All animations, styling, and final layout logic were handcrafted and fine-tuned by me.
* Inspired by the original site, I enhanced the experience with parallax, kinetic type, and custom cursor behavior.

## Features Implemented

* âœ¨ **Kinetic Typography** with scroll-based word reveals
* ðŸ’§ **Fluid button ripple** using blur and scale animations
* ðŸ§  **Real-time blur transitions** on hover and scroll
* ðŸŽ¯ **Animated Hero section** with custom scroll indicator
* ðŸ“± Fully responsive across screen sizes
* ðŸ“Œ Sticky Navbar with interactive links
* ðŸŒ€ Cursor animation with ripple and follower
* ðŸš€ Animated feature cards with subtle motion hover effects
* ðŸ“ˆ Loader and section transitions
* ðŸ§© Modular file structure with reusable components
